The analysis integrates multiple large-scale datasets—Revelio workforce profiles, Lightcast job postings, KPSS patent data, and Compustat financial metrics—covering 2,704 publicly traded U.S. firms over the period 2013–2023.

All scripts are designed to fully reproduce the empirical results, regression analyses, and visualizations presented in the manuscript. This includes the construction of latent talent-embedded capability stocks for AI capability (AIC) and people-centred innovation capability (PCIC), as well as the empirical testing of their complementary effects on firm-level patent-based innovation outcomes (overall and AI-related patent quantity and impact).
